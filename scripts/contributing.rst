Getting Involved 
================ 

If you are interested in
contributing the recommended procedure is to check on the `Sunlight
Labs Wiki`_ and in the repository to see where your state is.  The
next step is to announce your interest on the `Fifty State Project
Google Group <http://groups.google.com/group/fifty-state-project>`_
(this is where you can ask questions and make suggestions regarding
the project).

It is preferred for the sake of maintenance that scripts are written in 
Python, several Ruby scripts also exist if you are unfamiliar with Python.

If you are completely unfamiliar with Python or Ruby writing a scraper in
another language is preferred over not contributing at all but given the
number of scripts already written in Python you are strongly encouraged to
consider it first.

Regardless of whichever language you choose we prefer that you keep
the number of dependencies to a minumum.  For a list of libaries that
we encourage you to use see :ref:`python-dependencies`.

For licensing information, see :ref:`licensing`.

Writing a Parser In Python
==========================
If you choose to write your parser in Python, we have created some
tools that take care of writing data to the database.  The source code
of these tools is located in the *scripts/pyutils* directory
